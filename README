OVERVIEW
========

The MasterKey Widget Set, or MKWS, is a project to create some very
simple HTML/JS/CSS widgets that can be dropped into ANY website,
irrespective of CMS or lack thereof, to enable MasterKey searching.

Makefile -- delegates to tools/htdocs/Makefile
tools 	 -- the tools that make up the Widget Set

Required devel tools
====================

On debian, you will need:
$ sudo apt-get install curl git-core pandoc yui-compressor node-js libbsd-resource-perl

On Debian 7 (wheezy), you do not need git-core, plain git will do, but
you probably have that on a development box already. Unfortunately, node-js
is not available for wheezy. Either you can get it from wheezy-backports,
or you can download the source from http://nodejs.org/download/ and build
it yourself. Looks like you need node and npm, make install puts them
into /usr/local/bin.

For apache setup, see tools/apache2/README
