OVERVIEW
========

The MasterKey Widget Set, or MKWS, provides HTML/JS/CSS widgets that
can be dropped into ANY website, irrespective of CMS or lack thereof,
to enable MasterKey searching. See the contents of the "doc" directory
for further documentation.

Required devel tools
====================

On debian, you will need:
$ sudo apt-get install curl git-core pandoc yui-compressor node-js libbsd-resource-perl

On Debian 7 (wheezy), you do not need git-core, plain git will do, but
you probably have that on a development box already. Unfortunately, node-js
is not available for wheezy. Either you can get it from wheezy-backports,
or you can download the source from http://nodejs.org/download/ and build
it yourself. Looks like you need node and npm, make install puts them
into /usr/local/bin.

To compile the default templates you'll need to install the stable version
of Handlebars. Currently it's at 1.3.0 and available by npm:

  npm install handlebars@1.3.0 -g

For apache setup, see tools/apache2/README
