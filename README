OVERVIEW
========

The MasterKey Widget Set, or MKWS, provides HTML/JS/CSS widgets that
can be dropped into ANY website, irrespective of CMS or lack thereof,
to enable MasterKey searching. See the contents of the "doc" directory
for further documentation.

Required devel tools
====================

If you are building the widget set, as opposed to just using it, you
will need the following Debian packages (or their equivalents on your
operating system):

$ sudo apt-get install curl git pandoc yui-compressor libbsd-resource-perl

You also need Node.js, but unfortunately the node-js package is not
available for Debian wheezy. You can either get it from
wheezy-backports or download the source from
http://nodejs.org/download/ and build it yourself. You need node and
npm, its package manager: make install puts them into /usr/local/bin.

To compile the default templates you'll need to install the stable version
of Handlebars. Currently it's at 2.0.0 and available by npm:

  npm install handlebars@2.0.0 -g

For apache setup, see tools/apache2/README
