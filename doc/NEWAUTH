Set "Referring URL" to URL of the MKWS application, e.g.
http://x.example.indexdata.com/mike.html

Set "Host Name" to name of the host where the SP is accessed. e.g.
sp-mkws.indexdata.com

Set User Name and Password to values specified in auth URL.

IP Address doesn't seem to work. Search is:
http://mkc-admin.indexdata.com/torus2/identity.USERS/records/
	query=ipRanges encloses/net.ipAddress "127.0.0.1"
And that always gets hit by one of the many records with ipRanges set
to 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255.
