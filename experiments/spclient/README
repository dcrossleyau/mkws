An embryonic MasterKey Widget Set
=================================

This directory contains an embryonic MasterKey Widget Set, based
initially on "jsdemo" though now far removed from those beginnnings.

The goal is to make it that as much of the searching functionality as
possible is hosted on
	http://mkws.indexdata.com/
so that very simple websites such as
	http://somesite.indexdata.com/
can have MasterKey searching with minimal effort.

The following files must be hosted on mkws.indexdata.com:
	mkws.js
	mkwsStyle.css
	/libjs-pz2/pz2api.1.js

The following files make up the application:
	index.html
	favicon.ico [optional]
	robots.txt [optional]
