In its current form, this is very close to
/usr/local/src/git/pazpar2/www/jsdemo/

- It uses indexdata_logo.png directly from that location
- It uses styles.css directly from that location
- It uses pz2.js directly from /usr/local/src/git/pazpar2/js
- Its HTML (index.html) differs only in a few lines:
	diff /usr/local/src/git/pazpar2/www/jsdemo/index.html index.html
	- It has a boolean indicating whether the SP is in use
	- When that is set it performs simple authentication
	  (The username/pw are hardwired into the Apache2 config)
- Its JavaScript (example_client.js) differs more
- A simple favicon.ico is added to avoid spamming the error-log with 404s
- A simple robots.txt is added
