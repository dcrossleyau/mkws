    <h1>MKWS: the MasterKey Widget Set</h1>
    <p>
      This site contains tools, not content:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="mkws.js">mkws.js</a>
        --
        JavaScript code that powers the MasterKey Widget Set
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/libjs-pz2/pz2api.1.js">/libjs-pz2/pz2api.1.js</a>
        --
        Low-level JavaScript library for access to the MasterKey web
        service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mkws-complete.js"
                >mkws-complete.js</a>
        --
        A single large JavaScript file containing everything needed for
        MKWS to work: the widget-set itself, the API library, and any
        additional prerequisites such as jQuery.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mkwsStyle.css">mkwsStyle.css</a>
        --
        A stylesheet which styles only MasterKey widgets, and does not
        otherwise interfere with application-site's styles.
    <!--
        <p style="color:darkred">
          Note. This is not yet quite true: the stylesheet needs tweaking
          to make it more specific to only the MKWS components. At present
          it spills over into styling parts of the containing site, too.
        </p>
    -->
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For examples of how to use the widget-set, see:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A very simple application at
        <a href="http://somesite.indexdata.com/"
                >http://somesite.indexdata.com/</a>.
        It's worth viewing the source to see how small it is.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <a href="http://somesite.indexdata.com/jquery.html"
           >jQuery plugin</a>
        version, consisting of a single line of JavaScript code.
      </li>
      <li>
        An existing web-site,
        <a href="http://sagp.miketaylor.org.uk/"
           >The Self-Appointed Grammar Police</a>,
        which has been fitted with an MKWS searching widget.
        (See also the MKWS-widget customisations in
        <a href="http://sagp.miketaylor.org.uk/style.css"
           >that site's stylesheet</a>.)
      </li>
      <li>
	Another existing web-site,
        <a href="http://zthes.z3950.org/"
           >The Zthes specifications</a>,
	which has been fitted with a popup MKWS search-box.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Documentation is as yet in short supply:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <a href="README"
               >README</a> (which may not be fully up to
        date).
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="html-structure.txt"
               >structure of the HTML generated by the MKWS widgets</a>,
        which can be used to guide the customisation of its CSS styles.
