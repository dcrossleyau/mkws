<p>
  There is no content on the MKWS site, just tools:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="mkws.js">mkws.js</a>
    --
    JavaScript code that powers the MasterKey Widget Set
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/libjs-pz2/pz2api.1.js">/libjs-pz2/pz2api.1.js</a>
    --
    Low-level JavaScript library for access to the MasterKey web
    service.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="mkws-complete.js"
            >mkws-complete.js</a>
    --
    A single large JavaScript file containing everything needed for
    MKWS to work: the widget-set itself, the API library, and any
    additional prerequisites such as jQuery.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="mkwsStyle.css">mkwsStyle.css</a>
    --
    A stylesheet which styles only MasterKey widgets, and does not
    otherwise interfere with application-site's styles.
    <p style="color:darkred">
      Note. This is not yet quite true: the stylesheet needs tweaking
      to make it more specific to only the MKWS components. At present
      it spills over into styling parts of the containing site, too.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

  For a very simple application that uses these, see
  <a href="http://somesite.indexdata.com/"
          >http://somesite.indexdata.com/</a>.
  It's worth viewing the source to see how small it is!

  There is even a smaller version with one JavaScript file included and
  <a href="http://somesite.indexdata.com/index-simple.html">no configuration</a> and
  a <a href="http://somesite.indexdata.com/jquery.html">jQuery plugin</a> with
  a single line of JavaScript code.
