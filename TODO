Make a demo widget that displays an image, like the "From the Digital
Archive" panel of our Toronto Digital Library demo.

Make a widget demo that displays the top-hit full record rather than a
list of summary records. This can be used to pull in Wikipedia text to
make the bulk of a topic page.

Make an Amazon cover-art widget.

Blog about changing role of librarians: used to be mediators of scarce
information. Value now is increasingly as organisers of freely
available information. Will become more true as OA takes over.

Do target selection by UDB rather than ZURL. Needs SP changes.

Index Data's 20th birthday is this year.

THE WAY FORWARD

* Widget gallery
	Mainly a marketing thing on mkws.indexdata.com
	May also have a role in widget creation in MKAdmin
	We will want a facets-only widget, e.g. to list top authors
	Visualisations e.g. pie-chart of authors, bar-graph of records
		Generate embedded SVG? Does that even work?
	Demo of something embedded in our Koha installation
	Blog entries with interesting new widgets
* Administration
* Architecture:
  * Includes connectors
  * Managed widgets
  * 3rd party widget platforms
* Integration guides
* Use cases - workflows

In the widget builder, we want to expose capability information (from
ZeeRex or a Torus record) in a human-consumable form: "this target can
sort by recency", that kind of thing.

Auto-widgets should be able to include limits (as a full set of
MK2-like widgets does in order to implement facets).

Auto-widgets should be able to include filters (as a full set of
MK2-like widgets does in order to implement the Target facet). This
can be used to implement target categories,

Add a capability facet to MKAdmin. The right way to do this is to
refactor the current hardwiry facet code to be more data-driven, then
add a configuration element to include capabilities as a facet.

In the widget builder, we should be able to filter the targets
available to the widget on the basis of what requirements the widget
has, e.g. ability to sort by recency. The capability facet in MKAdmin
may suffice for this.

We need additional image-URL fields in our records -- in the connector
framework, in the Torus record's capabilities and elsewhere. Figure
out what's needed, and who needs to do it.

Can the IRSpy toroid be made to return a meaningful capability field?

Make MKAdmin able to filter target list on whether we have access:
that is, to targets that either are open-access or we have credentials
or an IP proxy for.

The widget-builder widget (WBW) should have a Save button that is
customised by a callback, so that the widget in question can (for
example) be copied into the clipboard, pasted into a nominated div,
saved to a database or whatever.
